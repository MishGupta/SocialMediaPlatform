26. **Repository:** A storage location where code and related files for a software project are stored and managed using version control.

27. **Agile:** A software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.

28. **Scrum:** A specific Agile framework that divides development into time-bound iterations called sprints.

29. **User Story:** A brief description of a software feature or functionality, often written from the user's perspective.

30. **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete.

31. **Mockup:** A visual representation of the user interface, often created using design tools, to illustrate the layout and elements of a web page or application.

32. **Wireframe:** A simplified visual representation of a user interface, focusing on layout and structure, often used in early design stages.

33. **Prototype:** A functional, interactive model of a software application used for testing and validation before development.

34. **Responsive Web Design:** Designing web applications to provide an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

35. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** A development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes and deploying them to production.

36. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** The initial version of a software product that includes the most essential features required for launch.

37. **Regression Testing:** The process of testing existing functionality after making changes to the software to ensure that new code doesn't break existing features.

38. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing conducted by end-users to determine if the application meets their requirements and expectations.
